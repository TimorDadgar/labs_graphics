Question: 1
What value does your BRDF return for the red/green/blue channel? Why?


Answer: 1
A simple lambartian brdf isn't dependent on the function arguments and can be simply
recreated by putting the light to a constant value. In our case we chose
(0.3, 0.8, 0.8) since it gives a clear distinction of where the matte surface is. 
Light is multiplied by 3 to get a brighter light. 


Question: 2

Answer: 2

plot is included as a "bifogad fil" and a python code called brdf_1dgraph.py
