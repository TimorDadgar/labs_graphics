Question 1:
How does your image change if you increase or decrease i_focal_dist? Can
you explain this?

Answer 1:
Increasing or decreasing the i_focal_dist will increase and decrease the zoom of the view.
This because L * focaldist + R(x-size.x/2) + U(y-size.y/2)
L * focaldist blir då förhållandet mellan kameran och objektet.


Question 2:
How could you implement super-sampling for anti-aliasing here, to get
smoother edges of the spheres, and less aliasing issues on the checkerboard
texture?

Answer 2: 
For smoother edges of the spheres and for less aliasing on the checkerboard, one could implement
two different solutions. Instead of casting a single ray that goes through the centre of each pixel, 
One solution would be to randomize the direction within the pixel's area which will make the ray not super straight.
Second solution is to send out a lot of rays and by calculating the average we can get diverging rays.



Question 3:
How does the maximum depth (MAX_DEPTH) influence the appearance of the
scene? How would a refractive object appear at a ray depth of 1, 2 and 3? How
about reflective objects? At which depth does your scene no longer change by
increasing the ray depth further? Why?

MAX_DEPTH 1: Doesn't have any bounces.
MAX_DEPTH 2: Has one bounce/reflection and here we can see our initial reflection.
MAX_DEPTH 3: Here there is a lot more reflections of many objects "recursively". 
MAX_DEPTH 10: Not too different from 3, slightly more refined reflections. The weight of the rays and visibility of them are slim to none after so many iterations of the rays.

Increasing the ray depth doesnt matter when the weight of the ray has become small enough.(close to 0)
